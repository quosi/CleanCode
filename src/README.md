# User Instructions

Please find here information about the usage of the IQA Analyzer module, its capabilities and requirements to run it successfully.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* conda environment (or you favorite virtual env)
* Python modules from ```src/requirements.txt```:
  + numpy1
  + pandas
  + matplotlib
  + bokeh
  + glob2
  + pytest
  
 Tested on:
 
 Software | Version
 ---------|---------
 MacOS    | Cataline 10.15.7 
 Python   | 3.7.6
 pip      | 20.0.2
 pytest   | 5.3.5
 
  
## Simple Setup Instructions
 
* Setup your virtual environment (recommended: conda environment)
* Install Python and pip 
* Install required python packages with pip installer
  ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Start ```src/main.py``` python script with required command line arguments for:
    + main directory path of your IAQ log files ```-i /User/ada/...log/ictcp/```
    + main output path for your plot files ```-o /User/ada/...plots/```
    + use the ```-h```argument for help

<b>Sample Command Line:</b>

 ```$ python3 main.py -i /User/ada/iqaProject/logfile/ictcp/ -o /User/ada/iqaProject/plots/ictcp/``` 
 
## Sample Data
 
The directory ```sampleData/``` in this repository contains examples of logfiles from certain image quality assesment tools that can be processed by this python module. These fouders and its content shall give an idea how to structure your files to stay on top of things with bigger data sets of logging information.

 <b>The following metrices are supportet: </b>
* Delta E ICtCp to evaluat colour difference in [ICtCp colour space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp)
* Delta E CIE2000 to evaluate colour difference in [CIE200 colour space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIEDE2000)

## Data Visualisation
 
Running this scripts on the main foulder of your logfiles will produce static ```staticPlot.png``` and interactiv ```interactivPlot.html``` data visualisation. Look inside the main.py python script for detaled example usage of the two main components of this module, the ```IqaLoggingProcessor```and ``ÃŒqaPlotter``classes or use the above discribed comandline interface.

Now your are all set and your results should look like this:

![interactivPlot.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quosi/CleanCode/main/img/examplePlot1.png "Example interactiv plot of DeltaE CIE2000 data")
