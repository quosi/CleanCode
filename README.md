# Apply CleanCode 

As this bundle of data analysis code grew to the medium size collection of a python scripts, it is perfect for a little Clean Code exercise. The following steps where applied in order to create an easy to use and clean python application. <br>

## STEP 1

<img align="right" width="140" src="img/screenshot2.png" alt="Initialise git and clean up working files">
Some steps to create a nice ditigal working environment for a clean start:
- initialise a git repository for version controll and link it to a remote URL
- create and/or activate your virtual environment for this project
- move working files like ```*.ipynb``` out of this repository or at least
- create a ```.gitignore``` file do hide certain files like ```notes.txt``` from git version controll
- draw diagram to plan code structure
- tea break ‚òï

## STEP 2

Now its about time to dig into this code collection and start cleaning!
- delet unused imports
- restructure code as planed
- create python classes and modules to include all previously scattered processing functionality
- get rid of redundant / duplicate code
- make all function names camelCase
- rename variables to show there intention
- delet unnecessary functionality <br>
  like the processing of ```global max```, ```global min```, ```global mean``` and ```global average``` values in the example code
- deleted unnecessary columns from dataframe <br>
  like ```algo```, ```dm tools```, ```target``` and ```size``` values in the example code
- more tea ‚òï

## STEP 3

- write unittests
- solve bugs üêû
- add main.py script to inherit all processing functionality
- add command line interface for easy handling
- solve more bugs üêú
- add documentation to functions and classes
- write ```requirements.txt``` to collect used python libraries
- write basic user instructions in ```README.md``` file for your git repository
